 explains how ("<strong>Company</strong>,"
 "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," and "<strong>our</strong>") uses cookies and similar
 technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at </span></span><span></span><span><span> ("<strong>Website</strong>"). It explains what these technologies are
 and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</span></span></span></div><div></div><div><span><span><span>In some cases we
 may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we combine
 it with other information.</span></span></span></div><div></div><div><span><span><strong><span><h2>What are cookies?</h2></span></strong></span></span></div><div><span><span><span>Cookies are small
 data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are
 widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as
 well as to provide reporting information.</span></span></span></div><div></div><div><span><span><span>Cookies set by the
 website owner (in this case, ) are called "first-party
 cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies."
 Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the
 website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these
 third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also
 when it visits certain other websites.</span></span></span></div><div></div><div><span><span><strong><span><h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2></span></strong></span></span></div><div><span><span><span>We use first- and third-party
 cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our
 Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other
 cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on
 our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our
 Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</span></span></span></div><div></div><div><span><span><span><span><span id="control"><strong><span><h2>How can I control cookies?</h2></span></strong></span></span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span>You have the right
 to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your
 preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which
 categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are
 strictly necessary to provide you with services.</span></span></span></div><div></div><div><span><span><span>The Cookie Consent
 Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our Website. If you choose to reject cookies,
 you may still use our Website though your access to some functionality and areas of our Website may

 not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar
 technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or
 "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables
 us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or
 opened an email including them. This allows
 us, for example, to monitor </span><span><span><span>the traffic patterns of users from one page within a
 website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether
 you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party
 website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing
 campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function
 properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div></div><div><span><strong><h2>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h2></strong></span></div><div><span><span>Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local
 Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of
 our services, fraud prevention, and for other site operations.</span></span></div><div></div><div><span><span>If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can
 adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in
 the </span></span><span><span><a

 can also control Flash Cookies by going to the </span><span><a

 rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Global Storage Settings
 Panel</span></a></span></span><span><span> and </span><span><span>following the
 instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing
 Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from
 being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how
 to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at
 the time).</span></span></span></div><div></div><div><span><span><span>Please note
 that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or
 impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications
 used in connection with our services or online content.</span></span></span><span><span></span></span></div><div></div><div><strong><span><h2>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h2></span></strong></div><div><span><span>Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to
